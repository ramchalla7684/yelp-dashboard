If you downloaded [yelp-backend-service](https://github.com/ramchalla7684/yelp-backend-service) and setup a server locally, then you have to change the `BASE_URL` in `js/data-store.js` to `http://127.0.0.1:3100`

_All the scripts and style sheets are tested on Chrome browser - v81, but works on most of the modern browsers_
